Makers graduate, musician, and esports enthusiast with a penchant for logical thinking who quit his full-time job of 8 years to chase a software development career. A huge believer in treating people as individuals and being able to laugh even in stressful situations!
Excelled in previous roles by successfully incorporating a creative instinct paired with a straightforward, rational approach to solving problems and improving projects.
Forever intrigued by new technologies, seeking to understand them, and a strong proponent of going against the status quo. Just because something came first, doesn't make it better. There are always improvements that can be made!

Project | Description | Tech | Info | Image
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | 
[Hexdrum][2] | A browser based drum machine | Javascript, HTML, CSS | An experiment to combine my love of music and coding as well as test my CSS & JS skills. It's also pretty fun to play around with! This was built over a year before joining Makers, demonstrating that I am capable of learning on my own without set course material.| <img src="http://lushcodes.com/images/gallery/thumbs/08.jpg" width="3000" title="Congrats, you have found the secret text!">
[Blitz VST][4] | React E-Commerce Site | React, Commerce.js, Stripe, JS, CSS | After choosing to use React for our final Makers project, I wanted to see if I could learn and use it more as I enjoy the file structure and components it provides. I also wanted to produce a working e-commerce app and was curious how the Commerce.js and Stripe API's functioned. Once again, I used my musical influence to create a shop for Virtual Studio Technology plugins - a 2021 music producer's best friend, but unfortunately quite expensive! |<img src="http://lushcodes.com/images/gallery/thumbs/07.jpg" width="3000" title="Congrats, you have found the secret text!">|
[Chitter][3] | A place for posts | Javascript, HTML, CSS (Skeleton) | My Chitter challenge during the main course. I wanted to try and produce a functional and visually pleasing app so I experimented using the skeleton.css framework. It wasn't something I'd used before this attempt but I am happy with the results! I loved how their code is formatted too! Very nice.| <img src="https://i.ibb.co/kDd79bs/Capture.png" width="3000" title="Congrats, you have found the secret text!">||https://ibb.co/jwpNW0P

## <a name="skills">ü§∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Skills</a>

- **Quick Learner** - Able to demonstrate the ability to learn and use new technologies in a short time frame. I opted into researching and using React, Node.js, and Express along with the Jest test suite for the final 2-week project of the Makers coding bootcamp. It was a decision that paid off as we were able to complete some of our stretch goals and deliver a great product in just 2 weeks.<br><br>
- **Self Starter** - During my time as a manager, there were regular questions from staff as to what information we required from customers before their insurance cases could be referred. It was such a persistent problem with such a seemingly simple answer that it spurred me to try and build a solution myself. I managed to create a local intranet of sorts using HTML5, CSS3 & Javascript and productivity skyrocketed. It was an idea that I proudly expanded until it was used by the entire department, saving costs equivalent to 4 FTE salaries per year.<br><br>
- **Creative Thinker** - In my previous job, an initiative was launched to generate ideas to reduce costs. I was able to identify that there were vast amounts of unused file space within our network. My suggestion was to comb through legacy data and folders to find what information was relevant and scrub those that were defunct. It ended up being a surprising amount and saved on data space as well as cost significantly. I received an award for my idea and was given the responsibility of spearheading the process on how to sufficiently ensure that the correct files were maintained.<br><br>
- **Empathic Team Member** - I am extremely comfortable with being honest about how I feel and this has in many situations made it easier for my team members to feel less stressed or anxious themselves. During a retro with the coaches on the first week of the Makers course, I openly admitted to the group that I felt like things had gone over my head. Afterward, I received several DM's from my cohort members thanking me for being so vulnerable. They were relieved that I had voiced my feelings and that it made them feel less alone or afraid to speak up. It also brought me closer to the team and helped develop a sense of togetherness and unity.

## <a name="experience">üîÆ Experience</a>

**Markerstudy Group - Insurance Company** (Jan 2013 ‚Äì May 2021)<br>
*Broking Manager*
- Managing a small team required developing strong emotional competency skills. I ensured that everyone was treated equally but as an individual and made it known that I was an individual too. This was appreciated by staff and made it easier to deal with difficult situations.
- Lead discussions on important changes and frequently highlighted risks which were crucial in not only creating a better product but also keeping us on schedule.
- Brought tangible benefits to the business with the generation and implementation of creative ideas which reduced costs and overheads.
- In-depth product and system knowledge meant other employees regularly deferred to my judgment on several topics and made me the primary point of contact for a multitude of issues. As a result, I was well respected and trusted amongst my peers.<br><br>

**Thomas Sanderson - Blinds Manufacturer** (Jan 2012 - Jan 2013)<br>
*Partnership Sales Executive*
- Promoted within 3 months, learning quickly whilst maintaining a high conversion rate. Extremely proud that my sales technique reflected my personable and polite manner as opposed to brute force or a numbers game.

**Hardly Heroes - Live Band** (Sept 2007 - Jan 2013)<br>
*Professional Vocalist*
- Trusted leader during decision making. Able to rationalise, think objectively, and act without bias when it came to disagreements. This helped conquer any issues that arose during writing and allowed us to move forward quickly without negativity.
- Diligent preparation and time management during recording sessions. Ensured everyone knew their role and encouraged any creative changes to be laid down beforehand. This lead to great results and high praise from sound engineers.
- Maintained steady bookings and repeat business due to my enthusiasm and quick response times which were critical to success.
- Supported and met many amazing artists such as Paul McCartney, The Zutons, and Queens of The Stone Age.<br><br>

**Quickcade - Charity Speedrun Events** (Jan 2019 - Present)<br>
*Marketing & Design*
<br>
- Enthusiasm to get things right for others caused deadlines, briefs, and multiple iterations of design to be adhered to and produced. 
- Ability to understand and talk to people has produced good relationships and connections since the events' inception.
- High quality of work meant organisers were happy to use designs in an official capacity live on stream and have asked me to return for other events in the future.<br><br>

## <a name="interests">üéµ Interests</a>

I enjoy making indie video game soundtracks for budding game developers, participating in weekly game jams when I can.
It's great to have accountability and a strict deliverable timeframe rather than filling my hard drive with 100's of unfinished tracks.
I also get feedback and rankings from developers to help improve my songs, which is great!
You can check out some of my tracks [here](https://soundcloud.com/octonyte).

I make some top-tier carrot cake. 
It's my goal to one day participate in (and complete) a good, honest DnD campaign. It's something I've always wanted to do but never had the chance. Yet!
