## Luke Usher

A sentence about who and what you are. Then a sentence about what you've achieved. And then a sentence about what excites you about tech.
A musician and esports enthusiast with an penchant for logical thinking who quit his full time job to chase a software development career.
Excelled in previous roles by successfully incorporating a creative instinct paired with a straightforward, rational approach to solving problems and improving projects.
Forever intrigued by new technologies, seeking to understand them and a strong proponent of going against the status quo. Just because something came first, doesn't make it better.
There are always improvements that can be made.

## Skills


Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider your best skills. Pick 2-4 skills and write a short descriptive paragraph for each one. You should demonstrate how capable you are at this skill with examples.
(Using a STAR example Paragraph) Consider the questions below.

-STAR
-What was the situation/task? (ST)

-How was the skill used?

-What did you do? (action)

-What was the result?


#### Creative Thinking

During my time at Markerstudy, an initiative was launched to generate ideas to reduce costs. I was able to identify that there were vast amounts of unused filespace within our network.
My suggestion was to comb through relic folders to find what information was relevant and scrub those that were defunct. It ended up being a surprising amount and saved on data space as well as cost significantly.
I received an award for my idea and was given the resonsibility of spearheading the process on how to sufficiently ensure that the correct files were maintained.

#### Attention To Detail

Descriptive paragraph of how capable you are at this skill and, if relevant, how it has developed (again use STAR for this)

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)

From 15 years old, I was the lead singer and bassist in a local band, 'Hardly Heroes'.

We supported and met several well established bands and artists, including but not limited to:

- Paul McCartney
- The Zutons
- Queens of The Stone Age
- Trent Reznor
- Faithless
- Young Knives
- Emptifish
- Snow Dogs
- Lil Chris

Although we no longer play, I have a soundcloud playlist with all of our recorded tracks still available to [listen](https://soundcloud.com/luke-usher-964328048) to.

## Hobbies

I enjoy making indie video game soundtracks for budding game developers, participating in weekly game jams when I can.
It's great to have accountability and a strict deliverable timeframe rather than filling my harddrive with 100's of unfinished tracks.
I also get feedback from developers to help improve my songs, which is great!
You can check out some of my tracks [here](https://https://soundcloud.com/octonyte).

It's my goal to try and participate in (and complete) a good, honest DnD campaign. It's something I've always wanted to do but never had the chance. Yet!
