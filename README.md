### Luke Usher

A musician and esports enthusiast with a penchant for logical thinking who quit his full time job of 8 years to chase a software development career.
Excelled in previous roles by successfully incorporating a creative instinct paired with a straightforward, rational approach to solving problems and improving projects.
Forever intrigued by new technologies, seeking to understand them and a strong proponent of going against the status quo. Just because something came first, doesn't make it better. There are always improvements that can be made! 

### <a name="skills">ðŸ¤¹ Skills</a>

- **Quick Learner** - Able to demonstrate the ability to learn and use new technologies in a short time frame. I opted into researching and using React, Node.js and Express along with the Jest test suite for the final 2 week project of the Makers coding bootcamp. It was a decision that paid off as we were able to complete some of our stretch goals and deliver a great product in just 2 weeks.
- **Self Starter** - During my time as a manager, there were regular questions from staff as to what information we required from customers before their insurance cases could be referred. It was such a persistent problem with such a seemingly simple solution that it spurred me to try and build a solution myself. I managed to create a local intranet of sorts using HTML5, CSS3 & Javascript and the productivity skyrocketed. It was a such a such a success that I proudly expanded it until it was used by the entire department, saving costs equivalent of 4 FTE salaries per year.
- **Creative Thinker** - In my previous job, an initiative was launched to generate ideas to reduce costs. I was able to identify that there were vast amounts of unused filespace within our network. My suggestion was to comb through relic folders to find what information was relevant and scrub those that were defunct. It ended up being a surprising amount and saved on data space as well as cost significantly. I received an award for my idea and was given the resonsibility of spearheading the process on how to sufficiently ensure that the correct files were maintained.
- **Team-player** - Throughout the course at Makers, some of my favourite moments were born from group projects. I really enjoyed the camaraderie a team environment brings and seeing our builds grow day by day. I was heavily involved in organising tickets and doing code reviews and loved having a holistic view of what everyone's struggles and successes were.

#### Any other qualifications

From 15 years old, I was the lead singer and bassist in a local Portsmouth band, 'Hardly Heroes'.
This continued into my college and university years until we parted ways due to new interests, however it was an extremely informative part of my life.
Organising, booking, travelling, social connections. It was an eye opener on how to get things done and how to interect with the public and professionals alike.
We supported and met several well established bands and artists, including but not limited to:

- Paul McCartney
- The Zutons
- Queens of The Stone Age
- Trent Reznor
- Faithless
- Young Knives
- Emptifish
- Snow Dogs
- Lil Chris

Although we no longer play, I have a soundcloud playlist with all of our recorded tracks still available to [listen](https://soundcloud.com/luke-usher-964328048) to.

## Hobbies

I enjoy making indie video game soundtracks for budding game developers, participating in weekly game jams when I can.
It's great to have accountability and a strict deliverable timeframe rather than filling my harddrive with 100's of unfinished tracks.
I also get feedback and rankings from developers to help improve my songs, which is great!
You can check out some of my tracks [here](https://https://soundcloud.com/octonyte).

I make some top tier carrot cake. 
It's my goal to one day participate in (and complete) a good, honest DnD campaign. It's something I've always wanted to do but never had the chance. Yet!
